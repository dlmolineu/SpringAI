BT Travel Reimbursement Specifications/Guidelines
1.	Missing receipts will not be accepted or reimbursed unless it has been approved by his/her director.  An alternate form of documentation required (ie: credit card statement- will only reimburse up to $25)
o	You may provide a picture of the itemized receipt.  (If you’d like you can take a picture of the itemized receipt as soon as you receive it. You can then either keep the picture for backup or go ahead and email it to BT Admin Asst. to file. )
2.	Tips on meals from a drive thru or counter service will not be reimbursed. (If it isn’t a meal that you sit down for & are waited on tips are not reimbursable- per accounting)
o	Also know that if breakfast is provided by the conference & you purchase a coffee it will not be reimbursed because the meal was provided.
3.	Taxi rides to and from meals will not be reimbursed.  You are encouraged to use the options nearest to you.  (Hotel restaurant, restaurants within walking distance, room service OR provided by the conference)
4.	Alcohol:
o	Two (average size) with an evening meal only. (Lunch is not considered an evening meal)
o	If there is any question about the alcohol beverage(s) on the receipt it will be left up to your director’s discretion.
5.	All hotel charges are to be charged to the Company Credit Card.  (Room & Tax, room service, internet charges, incidentals etc)
o	This is so you will not have to provide a card for incidentals (unless the hotel requires one) and so we do not risk your entire hotel stay being charged to your personal card.
o	If there are any incidentals charged to the company card the traveler will be responsible for reimbursing Woodmen for those charges.
o	The BT Admin Assistant will take care of & make sure a credit card authorization is sent & on file with the hotel.
6.	All reimbursement requests and receipts must be turned into BT Admin Assistant for approval within 14 days of returning.
7.	A copy of your conference agenda/itinerary is required. This needs to be turned in with a copy of your reimbursement request & receipts for approval by BT Admin Assistant before your Director will approve the reimbursement.
